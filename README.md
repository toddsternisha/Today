# Today
In early 2022, I worked through Apple's [Develop Apps for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/) course to explore current best practices prior to WWDC22. The course involves building two apps: scrum-management app [Scrumdinger](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger) in SwiftUI, and reminders app [Today](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-today) in Swift and UIKit. 

All code in **Today** was entered in the process of working through the course, with the exception of `UIColor+Today.swift`, which was added from a download as instructed, along with the asset catalog.
